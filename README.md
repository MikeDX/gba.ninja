This is an emscripten port of https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m. It's using custom bindings to get pixel/audio/input/savegame data into & out of the emulator. (as opposed to using emstripten's built in file system and sdl support).

Eventually, it should work on all browsers that support WebGL. Currently, it also requires localStorage
(so Safari private browsing won't work).

# Build

Install nodejs and emscripten. Ensure that `node` and `emcc` are on your path. `npm install`.

Run `node build --opt` (the `--opt` is production mode) then `webpack`. Open `build/index.html`.

(Note that emscripten is bundled with and requires a version of node that is older than the minimum required version to run webpack. Use an up-to-date version of node to run webpack.)

## TODOs
 * Fix frame drop problems
 * Fix bug where audio stops if headphones are unplugged
 * Google Drive sync for save games
 * Touch controls
 * Loading screen
 * Enable frameskip on slow devices
 * Ability to load BIOS
 * Load ROM from URL
 * Support for roms in zip files
 * Cache roms in HTML5 FS
 * Mute button (should disable audio emulation)
